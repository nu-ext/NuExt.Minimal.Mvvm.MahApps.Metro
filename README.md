# NuExt.Minimal.Mvvm.MahApps.Metro

`NuExt.Minimal.Mvvm.MahApps.Metro` is a NuGet package that provides extensions for integrating [MahApps.Metro](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro), a popular Metro-style UI toolkit for WPF applications, with [NuExt.Minimal.Mvvm.Wpf](https://github.com/IvanGit/NuExt.Minimal.Mvvm.Wpf), a Wpf extension for the lightweight MVVM framework [NuExt.Minimal.Mvvm](https://github.com/IvanGit/NuExt.Minimal.Mvvm). This package includes services and components to facilitate the creation of modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interfaces using the MVVM pattern.

### Commonly Used Types

- **`Minimal.Mvvm.Wpf.DialogCoordinatorService`**: Provides dialog coordination services using MahApps.Metro dialogs.
- **`Minimal.Mvvm.Wpf.MetroDialogService`**: Implementation of `IAsyncDialogService` for Metro dialogs.
- **`Minimal.Mvvm.Wpf.MetroTabbedDocumentService`**: Manages tabbed documents within a UI.
- **`MahApps.Metro.Controls.Dialogs.MetroDialog`**: The class used for custom dialogs.

### Key Features

The `MetroTabbedDocumentService` class is responsible for managing tabbed documents within a UI that utilizes the Metro design language. It extends the `DocumentServiceBase` and implements interfaces for asynchronous document management and disposal. This service allows for the creation, binding, and lifecycle management of tabbed documents within `MetroTabControl`.

### Recommended Companion Package

For an enhanced development experience, we highly recommend using the [`NuExt.Minimal.Mvvm.SourceGenerator`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuExt.Minimal.Mvvm.SourceGenerator) package alongside this framework. It provides a source generator that produces boilerplate code for your ViewModels at compile time, significantly reducing the amount of repetitive coding tasks and allowing you to focus more on the application-specific logic.
